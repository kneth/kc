This directory contains a number of numerical routines. This file
explains them briefly.

KGadi.c
-------
It is a simulation program for reaction-diffusion systems in two
spatial dimensions. The scheme is based on Alternating Direction
Implicit scheme.

Author: Kenneth Geisshirt.


complex.*
---------
A small library for doing complex computations.

Author: Kenneth Geisshirt.


per1d.c
-------
This is also a simulation program for reaction-diffusion systems, but
it is only for one spatial dimension. It is based on Cranck-Nicolson.

Author: Kenneth Geisshirt.


matrix.*
--------
A small library for manipulating matrices and vectors. It contains
solvers for systems of linear equations.

Author: Kenneth Geisshirt.


eigen.*
-------
It contains a routine to computing eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a
general matrix.

Author: Kenneth Geisshirt (based on Keld Nielsen's Pascal code).


kksolver.c
----------
Driver for solvers for ordinary differential equations.

Authors: Keld Nielsen and Kenneth Geisshirt.


odeserv.*
---------
Service routines for ODE solvers.

Authors: Keld Nielsen and Kenneth Geisshirt.


odesolv.*
---------
ODE solvers.

Authors: Keld Nielsen and Kenneth Geisshirt.



integr.*
--------
A small library for integrating functions.

Author: Kenneth Geisshirt.

nonlin.*
--------
A library of functions to solving nonlinear algrebraic
equations.
