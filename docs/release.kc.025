Release note for Kinetic Compiler version 0.25. The version is
released in Semtember 1993. The packages includes code written by P.G.
Sorensen, K. Neilsen, O. Jensen (et al.) and K. Geisshirt. 

The Kinetic Compiler is a front-end to various other programs. The
main input is chemical models - a set of reactions - but ordinary
differential equations can also be used. Below the features are
summarised:

o Models can be up to 150 reactions and each reaction can evolve up to
  150 species.
o The rate of the reactions can be one of the following three:
  (i)   mass action (default)
  (ii)  power law 
  (iii) user-defined rate expression
o Ordinary differential equations can be specified instead of
  reactions, and ODE and chemical reaction can the mixed.
o Constraints on the concentrations can be specified. This reduces
  the dimension of the concentration spaces.
o All manipulations of expression are done symbolically, even
  differentiation.
o The Kinetic Compiler generates code which can - at the moment - be
  used to:
  (i)   dynamical simulations, i.e. finding the concentrations as
        function of time in a well-stirred reaction tank.
  (ii)  calculating various properties for the model.
  (iii) continuations with one parameter.
  (iv)  simulations of inhomogenous reactions, i.e. diffusion-reaction
        systems. 
o Two manuals are written:
  (i)   Programmer's reference manual
  (i)   User's manual
o Species related constants can be written into the model.

The program is written in ANSI-C and uses lex and yacc. The program is
easy to port to various platforms (tested on HP-UX and Linux). The
program is generating some Pascal code, but p2c can be used as
compiler for this code.
