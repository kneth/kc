<H1>Users' Manual to KCI</H1>

<P>Welcome to the KCI program. KCI is an abbriviation of Kinetic Compiler
and Integration and the main purpose of of the program is to simulate
chemical reactions and make that task easy for chemists so they do not
have to use to much time with computers.</P>

<P>The program is a joint project between several people. The two
major programmers are <A HREF="email:kn@kin.kiku.dk"> Keld Nilsen</A>
at <A HREF="http://www.kiku.dk"> Department of Chemistry, University
of Copenhagen</A> and <A HREF="http://virgil.ruc.dk/~kneth/index.html">
Kenneth Geisshirt</A> at <A HREF="http://virgil.ruc.dk"> Department of
Life Sciences and Chemistry, Roskilde University</A>. A number of
people has donated code or accepted that their code is distributed
together with KCI.</P>

<P>The main features of KCI are listed below:</P>

<UL>
<LI> Chemical reactions written in a "natural" fashion.
<LI> Couple reactions and ordinary differential equations.
<LI> Do dynamical simulations.
<LI> Do continuatoins.
<LI> Do sensitivity analysis.
<LI> Calculating various quantities from the mechanism.
<LI> Use stoichiometric constains.
<LI> Output is readable by GNUplot.
<LI> Ported to many platforms including DOS, <A HREF="http://www.linux.org">
Linux</A>, <A HREF="http://www.hp.com">HP-UX</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.sgi.com">IRIX</A>, Ultrix, AIX.
<LI> Has been used both in research and teaching undergraduate students.
</UL>

<HR>
<H1>Table of Contents</H1>

<P>The first thing you have to do is to install KCI. There are two different
ways, depending on whether you are using <A HREF="#DOSsect">DOS</A> or
a <A HREF="#UNIXsect">Unix</A> variant.</P>  

<P>The basic things are reviewed the these first sections:</P>
<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="#COMMsect">Comments.</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#NNSCsect">Numbers, names, species and concentrations</A>.
<LI> <A HREF="#EXPRsect">Expressions</A>.
</UL>

<P>An input file to KCI consists of five sections. They are described
more closely in the next sections.</P>
<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="#CONSTsect">Constants</A>.
<LI> <A HREF="#CTRLsect">Control statements</A>.
<LI> <A HREF="#REACTsect">Reactions and ODEs</A>.
<LI> <A HREF="#STOICHsect">Stoichiometric constraints</A>.
<LI> <A HREF="#INITsect">Initial concentrations</A> and 
     <A HREF="#SPECsect">species-related constants</A>.
</UL>

<P>To KCI there comes a number of "code generators". Each "code generator" 
does some numerical analysis. At the moment there are the following 
"code generators":</P>
<UL> 
<LI> Dynamical simulation using KKsolver.
<LI> Dynamical simulation using CVode.
<LI> Continuation using mcont.
<LI> Calculating various quantities.
<LI> Perform sensitivity analysis.
</UL>

<P>If you are in a hurry and just what to see how an input file looks
like, we have included one for you. You find it at 
<A HREF="#INFILEsect">the end</A> of this manual.</P>


<HR>
<H2><A NAME=t;A NAME="DOSsect">Installation under DOS.</H2>


<HR>
<H2><A NAME=t;A NAME="UNIXsect">Installation under a Unix variant.</H2>
<P>Installation under Unix variants are simple. You should do as follows.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Download the file <CODE>kc.tar.Z</CODE>.
<LI>Change to a temporary directory and move the file to it.
<LI>Unpack the file, i.e.<BR>
<CODE>
uncompress kc.tar.Z<BR>
tar xvf kc.tar<BR>
</CODE>
<LI>Change to the <CODE>kc</CODE> directory which has just been created.
<LI>Decide where you want KCI to be installed (let us call it 
<CODE>prefix</CODE>. On many systems, <CODE>/usr/local</CODE> would be a 
good place. 
<LI>Make now two directories - if they do not exists already - namely the
two direactories <CODE>prefix/bin</CODE> and <CODE>prefix/num</CODE>.
<LI>Run now the compilation script <CODE>kc-inst</CODE> with two
arguments: <CODE>kc-inst prefix PLATFORM</CODE>. The argument 
<CODE>PLATFORM</CODE> is the name of your system. If you run 
<CODE>kc-inst</CODE> without arguments, it will list the supported platforms.
</UL>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME=t;A NAME="COMMsect">Comments</H2>
<P>The input file to KCI may contain comments which are not used by
other than the user.</P> 


<HR>
<H2><A NAME=t;A NAME="NNSCsect">Names, numbers, species, and 
concentrations</H2>

<P>The four above quantities are essential for the KCI program. We will 
briefly explained them here, and you will find examples of their use in
other sections.</P>

<DL>
<DT>Names<DD> Names are a letters followed by a sequency of letters and/or
digits. Examples of valid names are:<BR><BR>
<CODE>
X<BR>
y653X<BR>
HelloWorld<BR>
</CODE><BR>
Note that capital letters and non-capital letters are disticted.

<DT>Numbers<DD> Numbers are written as you are used to when you are working
with computers. Examples of valid numbers are:<BR><BR>
<CODE>
42<BR>
-3.1415926535<BR>
1.0e-4<BR>
3.00e6<BR>
</CODE><BR>
Note that when you are typing in numbers in scientific notation, you have
to write it with a decimal-point, i.e. <CODE>5e8</CODE> is <B>not</B> a
valid number.

<DT>Species</DD> A species is almost the same as a name, i.e. a valid
name is also a valid species. But chemical compounds may have charges (i.e.
being an ion) or it can be a radical. For ions and radical the "charge" 
comes after the name in parentheses. The charge for a radical is period
(<CODE>.</CODE>). Examples of valid species are:<BR><BR>
<CODE>
H2O<BR>
SO4(-2)<BR>
H(+)<BR>
Cl(.)<BR>
</CODE><BR>
Please note that the charge of <CODE>-1</CODE> and <CODE>+1</CODE> is written
as <CODE>-</CODE> and <CODE>+</CODE>, respectively. Notice that 
<CODE>H(+)</CODE> and <CODE>H(.)</CODE> are two different species.

<DT>Concentrations</DD> Concentrations are written the way many chemists do,
i.e. the species surrounded by brackets. Examples of valid concentrations are:
<BR><BR>
<CODE>
[H2O]<BR>
[SO4(-2)]<BR>
[H(+)]<BR>
[Cl(.)]<BR>
</CODE><BR>

</DL>
<HR>


<H2><A NAME=t;A NAME="EXPRsect">Expressions</A>.</H2>
<P>Expressions are used all over the input file for KCI. For people used
to computers, expressions are easy. In this section we review how to use
them.</P>

<P>Let <CODE>expr<SUB>1</SUB></CODE> and <CODE>expr<SUB>2</SUB></CODE> be two
expressions. From these two expressions we can form a new expression 
<CODE>expr</CODE> as (the <CODE>-></CODE> should be read as "can be"):</P>

<P>
<CODE>expr -> expr<SUB>1</SUB> oper expr<SUB>1</SUB> </CODE><BR>
<CODE>expr -> func ( expr<SUB>1</SUB> )</CODE><BR>
<CODE>expr -> - expr<SUB>1</SUB> </CODE><BR>
<CODE>expr -> ( expr<SUB>1<?SUB> )</CODE><BR>
<CODE>expr -> name</CODE><BR>
<CODE>expr -> concentration</CODE><BR>
<CODE>expr -> number</CODE> 
</P>

<P>The <CODE> oper </CODE> is a binary operator, and it can be one of
the following: <CODE>**</CODE> and <CODE>^</CODE> (power-raising), 
<CODE>*</CODE> (multiplication), <CODE>/</CODE> (division), <CODE>+</CODE>
(addition) or <CODE>-</CODE> (subtraction).</P>

<P>The <CODE> func </CODE> is a function application, i.e. a unary operator. 
It can be one of the following: <CODE>exp</CODE>, <CODE>log</CODE>, 
<CODE>ln</CODE>, <CODE>sin</CODE>, <CODE>cos</CODE>, <CODE>tan</CODE>, 
<CODE>asin</CODE>, <CODE>acos</CODE>, <CODE>atan</CODE>, <CODE>sinh</CODE>,  
<CODE>cosh</CODE>, <CODE>tanh</CODE>, <CODE>asinh</CODE>, <CODE>acosh</CODE>, 
or <CODE>atanh</CODE>. Please notice that there is no square root; it can be
obtained by using the power-raising operator.</P>

<P>A word of guidance: use more parenthesis that you otherwise would do
on a piece of paper. The expression like <CODE>1/x+1</CODE> is interpreted
as 1 plus 1 divided by x.</P>

<P>A few valid expressions follow:</P><BR><BR>
<CODE>
5*x<BR>
log([H(+)])+2<BR>
exp(log(sin(x)))<BR>
-(x+1)<BR>
x**2+y^3<BR>
</CODE>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME=t;A NAME="CONSTsect">Constants</A><H2>
<P>Constants has two purposes in KCI. First, they set up how the computations
are going to be performed, and second, they are can be used to write more
clear and easily read input file. The first group of constants depend
on the code generator so they are explained together with each code
generator.</P>

<P>To define a constant is very simple. The syntax is <CODE>name = expr;</CODE>
- it is very important to remember the semicolon. <A HREF="#NNSCsect"> Names
</A> and <A HREF="#EXPRsect"> expressions</A> are explained elsewhere. If
the expression on the right hand side contains constants, they must be 
defined previously. Below you see some examples of definitions of constants:
</P>

<BR><BR>
<CODE>
pi = 3.1415926535;<BR>
everything = 42;<BR>
R = 8.31415;<BR>
T = 300;<BR>
A = 1.1e8;<BR>
Ea = 2000.1<BR>
k = A*exp(-Ea/(R*T));<BR>
</CODE> 
<HR>


<H2><A NAME=t;A NAME="CTRLsect">Control statements</A>.</H2>
<P>Control statements are used to control different parts of the 
KCI system. A control statement always begins with a hash mark 
(<CODE>#</CODET>). The control statements are listed below.</P>

<DL>
<DT>PRINT<DD> The <CODE>#print</CODE> control statement controls what
is written as output. After the <CODE>#print</CODE> comes a comma sepatated
list of <A HREF="#NNSCsect">concentrations</A> and/or 
<A HREF="#REACTsect">dynamical variables</A>. For example, the statement below
will make KCI only printout the values of <CODE>x</CODE> and <CODE>y</CODE>.
<BR><BR>
<CODE>
#print x, y;<BR>
</CODE>

<DT>PARAMETER<DD>
</DL>

<H2><A NAME=t;A NAME="REACTsect">Reactions and ODEs</A>.</H2>
<P>The reactions are of course the most interesting part of the input
file for KCI. In this section we will discuss two things: reactions and
ordinary differential equations (ODEs). As you may know, chemical reactions
are mathematically described as ordinary differential equations of first 
order, and the simulation of reactions is the same as solving differential
equations.</P>

<P>You can as user of KCI use chemical reactions or ODEs to desribe your
problem. And you can even mix reactions and ODEs. This is in some cases
a very good idea, e.g. if you want to include the temperature as a 
variable in your model.</P>

<P>We will refer to a dynamical variable as a variable given by an ODE.
Dynamical variables have to follow the rules of <A HREF="#NNSCsect">names</A>.
</P>

<P>Below you will find an example of a reaction. First, there is a number 
(<CODE>23</CODE>) which is the reaction number. Reaction numbers are integer
<A HREF="#NNSCsect">number</A> and must be unique. The reaction number is
followed by a colon (<CODE>:</CODE>). Then we have a list of the reactants.
Reactants are <A HREF="#NNSCsect">species</A> and there may be a stoichiometric
coefficient before them. The symbol <CODE>-></CODE> is KCI's symbol for a 
reaction arrow. Reaction arrows may be either <CODE>-></CODE> (forward
reaction) or <CODE><-></CODE> (forward and backward reactions). After the
reaction arrow there comes a list of products and the reaction is ended by
a semicolon (<CODE>;</CODE>). The next symbol is <CODE>k></CODE> which 
means the rate constant for the forward reaction. The symbol for the 
backward reaction is <CODE>k<</CODE>. The values of the rate constants is
an <A HREF="#EXPRsect">expression</A>.

do a dynamical simulation of bromate oxidation of cerium in an
open system.</P>
