# TODO

There is still some work to do with `kc`. Beside fixing bugs, the
following list shows with which priority different subject should be
done:

* Better reduction of expressions.
* Better memory allocation (especially in `symbmath.{c,h}`).
* Better documentation, both user's and programmer's manual.
* Reorganise the table manager.
* Rewrite the grammar, i.e. better error recovery and many more consistency checks.
